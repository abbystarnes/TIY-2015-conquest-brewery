                        With a crystal clear blonde body and fluffy white head, her effervescence emanates as she quenches your thirst and caresses your tongue with mild notes of Belma and Zythos and a delicate malt profile. Her warrior spirit can be experienced in the mild bitterness that is perfectly balanced with the refreshing, honey-like sweetness. Experience her for yourself.

                    <h4>Sacred Heart IPA</h4>

                    <p>
                        <span class="quote">“Rebels are we,  though heavy our hearts shall always be…  and no ball or chain, no prison shall keep;  we’re the Rebels of the Sacred Heart.”</span>

                        Sacred Heart IPA pays homage to the past while redefining the future. Though classed as an East Coast IPA, it is both balanced and bitter, both tropical and satisfying. Featuring late additions of a brand-new hop, Belma, from Puterbaugh Farms, that gives a massive pineapple and tropical character, Sacred Heart is then double dry hopped with Zythos and Centennial for a huge, juicy hop flavor that will satisfy the most hardcore of hopheads while maintaining an approachability that even a new craft beer drinker can enjoy.
                        A six-step mash lends a ridiculously complex malt backdrop to the main event: the hops. The glorious Tiger Flower that none of us can get enough of. With a clean and dry finish, Sacred Heart will leave you wanting to sip, just once more…

 Sweet and silky, the seductress uses the dark arts of chocolate malt and roasted barley to give your palate a ravishing experience that you will not soon forget.
By utilizing advanced mashing techniques rather than lactose sugar, Conquest has created a stout that is reminiscent of both a chocolate stout and a milk stout, but that is suitable for the lactose intolerant. There is enough sweet chocolate flavor that many have sworn we cheated. Judge for yourself.

                    <p>
                        <span class="quote">“Thou dost cheapen thy name, and that of thy father, by thy endless parading: art not an ardent warrior, but art a knave; a true warrior shews himself not by so many feats of valor, but shews himself by that part of him from whence valor pours forth: from his own heart.”</span><br><br>
Brewed as the West-Coast style compliment to Sacred Heart IPA, Warrior Heart uses fully twice the bittering hops as Sacred Heart and is mashed at a lower temperature and brewed with the addition of invert sugar, causing it to finish fermentation as a much drier and more bitter beer. Multiple late and dry hop additions of Warrior and Centennial give it an immensely grapefruity, piney and dank hop character.
Sacred Heart is for those that would like to have several in a session; Warrior Heart is for those that prefer their palate to be ruined after a few sips. Hopheads enjoy.

Somewhere between a scotch ale and a wee heavy, the mahogany body of this malty and complex ale is capped with a light tan head that gives off a toffee-like malt aroma combined with a subtle smokiness. We use a traditional scotch ale yeast strain from Edinburgh, and a very light touch of smoked malt to accentuate the smoky undertones of the yeast. The use of six different malts provides a rich and flavorful drinking experience that is perfect for a cold winter’s night.

Using only traditional ingredients, our Bavarian-style hefeweizen pays homage to the centuries-old brewing tradition in Bavaria. Utilizing 64% wheat malt in our grain bill, a traditional weissbier yeast, and a high fermentation temperature gives this beer a bready, fruity and complex character. Notes of banana, clove, and freshly baked bread caress the palate with an effervescent body that leads to a clean and dry finish.

Our humble homage to this battle commander of old is only produced during the fall season. The additions of chocolate malt and crystal malt, as well as rye malt, give this beer a distinctively complex malt character while maintaining both the subtle grainy spice that rye is prized for and the dry, husky robust grain character of a porter.
We call it a “dark rye brown,” as no other description has seemed to yet work. Enjoy.

                    <p>
                        The prevailing trend of late in the beer world has been to release “seasonal” beers sooner, ever sooner… most “Oktoberfest” Marzens being released in July or earlier. In adamant and flagrant disregard, even hostility towards this trend, we release Novemberfest in November… (and potentially again in March) This Marzen-style lager is nestled between a traditional Marzen and a German “festbier.” Slightly more golden in hue and with a lighter body than many Marzen style lagers, our Novemberfest still boasts a huge nutty malt profile, a bright German hop character, and a drinkability that is unmatched in the style. Prost!

You will see them end this suffering.<br> From the armories the angels sing. You will fear them when they lift their wings.<br> They will sing to a world reborn.<br> They will sing as I cut off your horns.<br> I’ll cut off your horns.</span><br>
